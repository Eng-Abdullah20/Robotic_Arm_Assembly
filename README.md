Robot Hand Assembly
The Robotic Arm was assembled and uploaded in an .stl extension. 
First, the base was imported and placed at the grid. Secondly, all the other parts were imported. 
The wrist was placed on top of the base and the arm was connected to it. Moreover, the gribber part was not to scale. So, the size had to be changed to match the the other parts and connect to the other parts with no issues.
Finally, all parts were grouped together.
